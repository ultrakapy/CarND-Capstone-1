## The CarND Capstone Project
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This project uses ROS nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following! The code is tested using the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases) and is executed on the Udacity self-driving car Carla.

### Results
The following video shows Carla autonomously driving along the *simulated highway track*. 
[![Scenario Highway in Simulator](https://img.youtube.com/vi/tZso-BjW6cQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZso-BjW6cQ)

The sections within the video:
* **top left**: */image_color* the image that is published by the camera
* **top right**: a visualization of ROS topics 
  * white line: */base_waypoints* - the road according to a map 
  * balls red/yellow/green: */vehicle/traffic_lights* - ground truth status and location of the traffic lights (for debugging, from simulator)
  * green line: */final_waypoints* - the next waypoints the car should follow
  * blue cone: */current_pose* - location and orientation of the car
* **bottom left**: result from traffic light detection including prediction score
* **bottom right**: simulator 

The following video shows how our code runs a real self driving car with traffic light detection.

### Discussion and Outlook
The car follows the track very well if the hardware is powerful enough. The results video was created on a MacBook Pro with 2,8 GHz Intel Core i7. ROS was executed in the Linux VM from Udacity using VMWare Fusion. The Simulator was executed natively in Mac.

We did not manage to get the ROS code and simulator running in the Udacity Workspace. There seemed to be some delay between ROS and the simulator which resulted in leaving the track.

In order to reduce the load, we implemented the following tricks:
  * reduced the traffic light detection rate to 5 Hz
  * reduced the frequency if published images by the bridge to the simulator
  * disabled publishing of lidar and obstacles data
  
As a next step we could try to further improve the timing of the nodes and try to reduce ceffort for computation and communication.


## System Architecture

### Code Structure
Below is a brief overview of the repo structure, along with descriptions of the ROS nodes. 

#### Traffic Light Detection Node
This package contains the traffic light detection node.
![image alt text](imgs/tl-detector-ros-graph.png)

See training code in [/training/](https://github.com/markbroerkens/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/training/) and inference code in 
[/ros/src/tl_detector/](https://github.com/markbroerkens/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/tl_detector/).

![image alt text](imgs/waypoint-updater-ros-graph.png)

See code in [/ros/src/waypoint_updater/](https://github.com/markbroerkens/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/waypoint_updater/).


#### Drive By Wire (DBW) Node
Carla is equipped with a drive-by-wire (dbw) system, meaning the throttle, brake, and steering have electronic control. This package contains the files that are responsible for control of the vehicle
![image alt text](imgs/dbw-node-ros-graph.png)

See code in [/ros/src/twist_controller/](https://github.com/markbroerkens/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/twist_controller/).

#### ROS to Simulator Bridge Node
A package that contains a server for communicating with the simulator, and a bridge to translate and publish simulator messages to ROS topics.

See code in [/ros/src/styx/](https://github.com/markbroerkens/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/styx/).

#### Waypoint Loader Node
A package which loads the static waypoint data and publishes to */base_waypoints*

See code in [/ros/src/waypoint_loader/](https://github.com/markbroerkens/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/waypoint_loader/).

  
#### Waypoint Follower Node
A package containing code from [Autoware](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware) which subscribes to */final_waypoints* and publishes target vehicle linear and angular velocities in the form of twist commands to the */twist_cmd* topic.

See code in [/ros/src/waypoint_follower/](https://github.com/markbroerkens/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/waypoint_follower/).


#### (debug) Visualisation Node
See code in [/ros/src/visualisation/](https://github.com/markbroerkens/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/visualisation/).

*Thanks to [Eric Lavigne and Team-Wolf-Pack](https://github.com/ericlavigne/CarND-Capstone-Wolf-Pack) for their inspiring ideas regarding the visualization.*

## Installation and Execution Instructions

This is the project repo for the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).

Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
